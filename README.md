# RAG_YouTube
A Retrieval augmented generation of a youtube video using Langchain,OpenAI and Python


Building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model on a YouTube video using LangChain, OpenAI API, and Python involves several steps. First, the video is transcribed into text using NLP techniques and tools like Whisper or other transcription services. The text is then tokenized using TikTokens, and the tokens are converted into vector embeddings via OpenAI's API. These embeddings are stored in a vector database like Pinecone or FAISS.

When a user submits a query, the model retrieves relevant embeddings from the database, uses them to fetch pertinent sections of the transcribed text, and then generates a response by leveraging OpenAI's language model. This approach combines retrieval-based and generative techniques to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers.
